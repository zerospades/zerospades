			 * its centre rolls off rather than clipping into a flat disc, fades to zero
			 * with no slope at the rim, and is dithered against banding in the dark.
			 *
			 * A power law has no scale of its own: more light only makes the same
			 * shape wider, which is how each layer below grows with the light.
			 *
			 * Its alpha at `r`, from 0 at the centre to 1 at the rim, is
			 * `1 - exp(-2 * (0.05 / (r + 0.05))^2 * (1 - r^2)^2)`, plus up to one
